Ethical Website Hacking with Python
This repository contains Python scripts and tools designed for ethical website hacking and security testing. The tools cover various aspects of web security, including information gathering, gaining access, and vulnerability scanning.

Each chapter folder contains tools discussed in that section, with separate README.md and requirements.txt files. Ensure you install the required dependencies before running any tool:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Chapter 2: Information Gathering
This chapter focuses on reconnaissance techniques to collect information about target websites.

domain_validator.py - Checks if a domain is valid and active.
domain_whois.py - Retrieves WHOIS records of a domain.
subdomain_scanner.py - Scans for subdomains associated with a target domain.
subdomains.txt - A wordlist for subdomain enumeration.
Email Extracting
